# Securing My Own AWS Cloud Environment

## About The Project
I am embarking on a project to design and implement a secure and scalable cloud environment using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The primary goal of this initiative is to host a static website and more while ensuring that all resources are well-architected, isolated, and protected against potential security threats.
